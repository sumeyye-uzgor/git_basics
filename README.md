# git_basics

# main/master branch is used for project deployment. Generally running websites are using main branch as base folder. Like www.facebook.com

# dev branch should be copied from main branch so it should contain its base changes like above comments. But includes more additions because development team using this branch to test website before changes can be noticable by users. Generally another web address assigned for this branch like dev.facebook.com or facebook.dev . This link is only for development team like developers or testers. When the changes in a dev branch brings us a new version that we can move those changes to main. We can think this as when dev branch is ready to go for version1.0 we can MERGE it to main. Or when second version comes we can make a merge for version2.0
