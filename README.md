# git_basics

# main/master branch is used for project deployment. Generally running websites are using main branch as base folder. Like www.facebook.com

# dev branch should be copied from main branch so it should contain its base changes like above comments. But includes more additions because development team using this branch to test website before changes can be noticable by users. Generally another web address assigned for this branch like dev.facebook.com or facebook.dev . This link is only for development team like developers or testers. When the changes in a dev branch brings us a new version that we can move those changes to main (MERGE). We can think this as when dev branch is ready to go for version1.0 we can MERGE it to main. Or when second version comes we can make a merge for version2.0

# feature branches are for features :D but what it means is we have to divide our tasks. But the important part of this small task is when you MERGE it to dev branch, it should be a standalone part (it should work without any changes). Think this as a navbar. Maybe you dont know where to navigate some links into navbar, then either you should navigate them to homepage or you shouldnt add those links or you should add navigation pages as template pages. If anything brokes your code in a feature then it is not a feature. When each feature completed you need to open a pull request to merge them into dev branch to build versions.
